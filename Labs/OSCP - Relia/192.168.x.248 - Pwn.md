The above was not the vector. I was able to smbclient -L against the IP addr, to see there was a transfer share. Upon connecting to the transfer share, I then proceeded to run:
- prompt OFF
- recurse ON
- mget *
This command will recursively download everything -> puts into folders on my desktop.
I went through and found 3 kdbx files (2 dead, 1 actual). I had to download keepass through sudo apt-get -y install keepassx -> then format/crack the kdbx file -> keepass2 Database.kdbx keepasshash.txt -> john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt keepasshash.txt file

I loaded keepassx, then cracked the password to open up the kdbx file leading me to quite a few passwords

I need to install poetry cme rdp instead of this script to password spray. I saw emma @ relia.com through one of the pdf's that I gathered (web page pdf and exiftool) so I tried her creds through RDP and was successful

PRIVESC

After rdp'ing into Emma's Desktop, I uploaded my tools.zip and went to work. I have been using both winpeas and privesccheck to verify I get the best of both worlds. Here I found user environment variables aka creds, and there's a mark user in the users directory.

I can rdp into the .248 as Mark to get proof flag with this
