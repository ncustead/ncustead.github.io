I was using CME smb, rdp, and winrm options to spray the password across the domain. PJPT showed a good method that passwords may be reused across the domain. As we can see, we got a hit on .83 -> yoshi:mushroom

NOTE TO SELF. Pwn3d -> Local Admin. I did not know that but good to know!! Read the CME documentation, when you get enough points unlock the cme module in academy
