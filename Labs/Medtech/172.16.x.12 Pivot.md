- Crackmap was not working the way I felt comfortable with in regards to RDP password spraying. 
- I took my internal IP list and found which IPs had RDP open. Need to tinker with the RDPPassSpray script to run against all IPs in a given list. But for now...I tried each IP individually

- Crackmap did not pick up on this and not sure why, so need to troubleshoot or shine a light on the usage of multiple tools trying to attack the same vector
