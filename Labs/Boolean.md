#### We begin the enumeration process with an nmap scan.

From the output we see ports 22 and 80 open on the target machine.

Starting with port 80 we see the following webpage.


We can proceed by enumerating all possible paths on port 80 using dirb.

```c
kali@kali:~$ dirb http://192.168.120.159
...
URL_BASE: http://192.168.120.159/
WORDLIST_FILES: /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt

##### Checking the 404 pages reveals the following:


```c
kali@kali:~$ curl http://192.168.120.159/404
...
  .rails-default-error-page div.dialog {
...
  .rails-default-error-page div.dialog > div {
...
  .rails-default-error-page h1 {
...
  .rails-default-error-page div.dialog > p {
...
<body class="rails-default-error-page">
  <!-- This file lives in public/404.html -->
```



We see the framework uses Rails, while the login and register paths return 200 OK responses, the filemanager path stands out.

Judging by the name it is most likely a file upload feature which is almost always worth checking out.

```c
kali@kali:~$ curl -sw '\n' http://192.168.120.159/filemanager
<html><body>You are being <a href="http://192.168.120.159/login">redirected</a>.</body></html>
```

Unfortunately it gets redirected to /login page, we will need to register a valid account.

Notice the footer text describes a type of file storage manager just like the filemanager path we discovered.

### Exploitation

This account confirmation page would appear after logging in.

Any attempt to go to any other pages like /filemanager will always gets redirected to this page.

As we're unable to authenticate as an offsec employee there is no way of receiving the confirmation link sent to the email.

##### _There is an option to edit the email in case of typo, let attempt to use Burp Suite to capture the request and responses._

We receive a JSON response with an email field reflected back on the confirmation page.

If we look closely, there is also a confirmed field with a boolean value false.

This field is most likely an indicator for the backend to tell if the account is already confirmed and to lock it out if it's not.

We've found out earlier what the web framework is used, a google search for Rails common web vulnerability will lead us here specifically the Mass Assignment vulnerability which looks promising.

The URL example is using GET while we deal with POST requests with user[email]=yoman@offsec.com parameters.

While the example was adding an admin attribute, we'll add confirmed instead with a boolean value true which will look like this user[confirmed]=true then send the request and see what happens.

We notice the confirmed value is now set to true, let's attempt to reload the confirmation page again.

After successfully bypassing the confirmation page, the file upload feature appears just like we suspect.

Let's create a test file and then try upload and download it.

```c
kali@kali:~$ echo just a test file > test.txt
kali@kali:~$ ls -l test.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 kali kali 17 Mar 20 13:39 test.txt
kali@kali:~$ cat test.txt
just a test file
```

Notice the changes in the URL bar when trying to download the file that gets uploaded, the file=test.txt parameter is interesting and usually the first sign to go and try a good ol' dot slash trick like ../../../etc/passwd but unfortunately, this time it won't get us anywhere.

Now if we look closely, there is cwd parameter that does not have values, it kinda looks like the pwd command on linux which used to print our (c)urrent (w)orking directory.

Let's use the same trick on this parameter and see what happens.

We've managed to traverse the path and go up to other directories using cwd parameters.

Since other directories are now browseable, we could potentially enumerate further by reading passwd or other sensitive files. However, there is a directory that stands out right away which is .ssh/, let's try to go into that directory.

Great, we're able to enter the directory which means the web service is likely run by the same user that owns this directory and has full permission.

There is a keys/ directory which screams for private keys but let's do better than that, let's generate RSA private and public key, rename the public key to authorized_keys and then upload it.

```c
kali@kali:~$ ssh-keygen -q -N '' -f sshkey
kali@kali:~$ ls -l sshkey*
-rw------- 1 kali kali 2590 Mar 20 19:33 sshkey
-rw-r--r-- 1 kali kali  563 Mar 20 19:33 sshkey.pub
kali@kali:~$ mv sshkey.pub authorized_keys
```

Awesome! the public key successfully uploaded, let's try logging in through SSH with the private key.

```c
kali@kali:~$ ssh -i sshkey remi@192.168.120.159
The authenticity of host '192.168.120.159 (192.168.120.159)' can't be established.
...
Linux boolean 4.19.0-18-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.19.208-1 (2021-09-29) x86_64
...
remi@boolean:~$
```

Privilege Escalation

After logging in as user remi, there is an alias that can be used to escalate to root easily.

```c
remi@boolean:~$ alias
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
alias root='ssh -l root -i ~/.ssh/keys/root 127.0.0.1'
remi@boolean:~$ root
Received disconnect from 127.0.0.1 port 22:2: Too many authentication failures
Disconnected from 127.0.0.1 port 22
```

Unfortunately the attempt was failed due to Too many authentication failures, a google search for the error message will lead us here.

Apparently this happened because of an SSH agent that would try to login with all identity keys that were added.

```c
remi@boolean:~$ ls -l .ssh/keys/
total 16
-rw------- 1 remi remi 1823 Feb 23 20:40 id_rsa
-rw------- 1 remi remi 1823 Feb 23 20:40 id_rsa.1
-rw------- 1 remi remi 1823 Feb 23 20:40 id_rsa.2
-rw------- 1 remi remi 1823 Feb 23 20:40 root
```

Using the IdentitiesOnly option with a boolean value true or yes will force SSH to explicitly use the identity specified in the command line.

```c
remi@boolean:~$ ssh -l root -i ~/.ssh/keys/root 127.0.0.1 -o IdentitiesOnly=true
Linux boolean 4.19.0-18-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.19.208-1 (2021-09-29) x86_64
...
root@boolean:~# whoami
		root                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
```
