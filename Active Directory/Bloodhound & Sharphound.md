- To use this, we need both Bloodhound and Sharphound
	- From AP, we need two things:
		- sudo neo4j console, creds should be neo4j:neo4j. We can connect on the http://localhost port given. In another terminal, we run bloodhound
		- bloodhound
	- From Victim, we upload sharphound.ps1
		- . .\SharpHound.ps1
		- Invoke-Bloodhound -CollectionMethod All -Domain <TargetDomain> -ZipeFilename file.zip
	- Look at File Transfer for Windows - Linux to look at upload techniques to bring back the file to the Kali AP.
